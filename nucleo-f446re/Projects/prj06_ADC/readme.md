VDD = Refrence voltage :   2.4 <  VDD < 3.6 V
 SAMPLE Rate = the number of sample we can take in Time
 Resolution = 

 step = V(ref) \ ((2^ resolution ) -1) â†’ mv

cycle + 12.5 =cycletotal
 the number of sample we take  = F(adc) \ cycletotal

NYQUIST's theorem state that a priodic signal must be sampled at more than twice the highest frequency component of the signal (ferequnce khandn bayad 2barabar ferequnce worodi bashad)
