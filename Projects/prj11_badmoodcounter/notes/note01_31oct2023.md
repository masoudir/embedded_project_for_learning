Delay must be placed in main thread, because we have no hard requirements in terms of time. other thread like interrupt needs short time to exercute 

    while (1)
    {
        /* USER CODE END WHILE */
        if(lcdmode==LCD_mode_0){
        
        welcome_screen();
        }
        if(lcdmode==LCD_mode_1){
        
        home_screen();
        }
        if(lcdmode==LCD_mode_2){
    
        setting_screen();
        }
        HAL_Delay(1000);
        /* USER CODE BEGIN 3 */
    }
